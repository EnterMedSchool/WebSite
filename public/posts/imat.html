          <p class="lead">Hey everyone! My name is Ari Horesh, and I am a medical student at the University of Pavia, Italy, where I study medicine in English. I started this website to help guide people through their first steps of finding information about the IMAT exam, which is the exam you must take to study medicine here in Italy, and studying here in general! In this article, I will discuss the IMAT exam, its format, different sections, and its history so you can fully understand the mindset in which you should approach this exam. The IMAT itself is fairly simple. However, the main challenge for this exam is the competition. You need to score as high as possible, so even if the questions are simple and easy to prepare for, it’s really about your strategy, correct preparation and efficiency. That’s what I’m here for! I hope this article will help you navigate and understand exactly what to expect and how to prepare for IMAT 2025.</p>
          <p>I recommend reading this article after learning more about medicine in Italy, as well as the different options and the ranking of the universities.</p>

          <p><strong>According to most recent estimations IMAT 2025 will take place mid September, 2025.</strong></p>
          <p>The International Medical Admissions Test (IMAT) is a crucial exam that takes place every September or October (the date changes if the Italians wait for the very last moment) and is designed for students who want to study medicine in English at universities in Italy. Currently, 16 universities use the IMAT as their primary entrance exam for international medical programs.</p>
          <p>I took the IMAT back in 2019. Since then, the exam has seen several significant changes. The most notable shift came during the IMAT 2023 when the responsibility for composing and managing the exam transferred from the Cambridge Assessment to the Italian Ministry of Education. This has introduced a new exam format and structure, making staying up-to-date with the latest information more important than ever.</p>
          <p>In this article, I’ll walk you through everything you need about the updated IMAT, from the new format and structure, how to register, the documents needed, and the most effective study strategies.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="what-is-imat" aria-labelledby="whatis">
          <h2 id="whatis">What Is The IMAT exam?</h2>
          <p>As mentioned earlier, the International Medical Admissions Test (IMAT) is the exam you’ll need to take if you want to study medicine in Italy in English. It first started in 2011, with the University of Pavia leading the way as the first institution to offer medical programs in English. When the IMAT exam started in 2011, it had 80 questions; they were easier than the other exams, and overall, it was not very well organized. This is why the exams from 2011 and 2012 aren’t a good reference point of studying for this exam or trying to take past papers as simulations.</p>
          <p>Now, not only Pavia, but 16 universities across Italy accept the IMAT as their primary (and only) entrance exam for these programs, and it seems like every year 1 or 2 universities are added, which is amazing!</p>

        <section id="exam-format" aria-labelledby="format">
          <h2 id="format">IMAT 2025 Exam Format</h2>
          <p>The IMAT is a 60-question multiple-choice exam with five options for each question. You’ll have 100 minutes to complete the exam, so time management is crucial, and exactly what I am working on with my students! The questions cover a wide range of subjects, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Critical Thinking</li>
            <li>Problem-Solving</li>
            <li>General Knowledge</li>
            <li>Biology</li>
            <li>Chemistry</li>
            <li>Math</li>
            <li>Physics</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="kpi" aria-label="Scoring and timing">
            <div class="box"><strong>Questions</strong><br/>60 MCQs (5 options each)</div>
            <div class="box"><strong>Time</strong><br/>100 minutes total</div>
            <div class="box"><strong>Scoring</strong><br/><span class="mono">+1.5</span> correct &middot; <span class="mono">−0.4</span> wrong &middot; <span class="mono">0</span> blank</div>
          </div>
          <p>One thing that makes the IMAT stand out is its scoring system. You’ll earn 1.5 points for each correct answer, but if you get a question wrong, you’ll lose 0.4 points. Since there’s no penalty for skipping questions, many students leave the ones they’re unsure about blank to avoid losing points. Students who don’t prepare well for this exam usually try to solve as many questions as possible and lose many points. If you check the PDF that is published every year with a list of all past scores of all of the candidates, you will be surprised how many people get really low scores but solved all 60 questions, it’s because they approach this exam without a proper strategy and idea of what they should do, which makes them fail.</p>
          <p>You have 100 minutes to solve all 60 questions on the IMAT. Unlike other exams, you have all of the questions in front of you, and you get to strategize how much time you dedicate to each section and questions – so strategy is crucial when it comes to taking this exam, which is unique.</p>

        <section id="breakdown" aria-labelledby="break">
          <h2 id="break">Breakdown of IMAT 2025 Questions</h2>
          <p>Here’s how the 60 questions are divided across the different subjects based on IMAT 2024. Please note that for IMAT 2025 it might change; I will update this guide when we get further information.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>2 General Knowledge questions</li>
            <li>7 Logical Reasoning questions (problem-solving and critical thinking)</li>
            <li>23 Biology questions</li>
            <li>15 Chemistry questions</li>
            <li>13 Math and Physics questions</li>
          </ul>
          <p>As you can see, a large portion of the exam focuses on Biology and Chemistry, so it’s essential to dedicate plenty of study time to these subjects. My students usually tend to start with Biology and Chemistry during their preparation. I recommend starting with Biology because it is more interesting and fun, so it will motivate you to stay consistent over the months. My favorite topics to study back in 2019 were physiology and cell biology. I also liked chemistry a lot – which is funny because I had around 500 students up to mow, and maybe 10 of them actually liked chemistry.</p>

          <h2 id="pp">How to Use Past IMAT Papers to Prepare</h2>
          <p>Past papers reveal recurring topics and question styles. From 2011–2022, Cambridge wrote the exam; since 2023, Italian organizations do—so emphasize 2023 &amp; 2024.</p>

          <h3>How to Get the Most Out of Past Papers</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>When to Start:</strong> Begin 2–3 months before the exam.</li>
            <li><strong>Simulate Exam Conditions:</strong> Print papers, set a 100-minute timer, remove distractions.</li>
            <li><strong>Review Everything:</strong> Analyze all questions (even the correct ones) to find patterns and traps.</li>
            <li><strong>Learn From Mistakes:</strong> Revise weak topics and watch for recurring themes.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Finding the recurring traps is the most important part of using past papers. There is also a video showing how to analyze mistakes using apps and Google Sheets.</p>

          <h2 id="docs">Which Documents Are Required to Take the IMAT Exam, and What is Pre-Enrollment?</h2>
          <p>Technically you can register by paying the fees, but it’s strongly recommended to sort the <strong>Declaration of Value (DoV)</strong> beforehand.</p>

          <h3>Declaration of Value (DoV)</h3>
          <p>The DoV is issued by the Italian embassy in your country. Translate your high school diploma into Italian (or notarize if already in English). It confirms equivalence to Italian secondary education.</p>

          <h3>Other Documents</h3>
          <p>Some universities may require English proficiency. 2025 requirements are still unannounced—watch updates and WhatsApp groups.</p>

          <h3>What is Pre-Enrollment? When Will It Start for IMAT 2025?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Pre-enrollment on university websites:</strong> Some (Messina, Milan, Pavia, Turin) request this—non-binding; typically in spring; small fee.</li>
            <li><strong>Pre-enrollment on Universitaly.it:</strong> Mandatory; ~2–3 months before registration; also helps non‑EU visa processes. If you have <em>permesso</em> and live in Italy, ensure it’s valid ≥12 months to benefit from EU seat competition.</li>
            <li><strong>IMAT Registration:</strong> Final step—pay the exam fee and secure your seat.</li>

          <h2 id="minimums">IMAT Minimum Admission Scores</h2>
          <p>Each university allocates seats differently for EU vs. non‑EU candidates, and this affects minimum scores. In 2024, non‑EU competition was particularly tough, pushing minimum scores higher for non‑EU candidates (opposite of earlier years).</p>

          <h2 id="scoring">How Do Admission Scores Work?</h2>
          <p>Seat counts and historical minimums are available under the “Universities” tab on the site. Admissions are relative—top scores fill seats—so cutoffs vary yearly and generally trend upward as competition grows. Keep an open mind and research all options rather than locking onto a single university.</p>
